## How to Use Github : 

GitHub has various advantages but many people often have a doubt as to why not use dropbox or any cloud based system? 
Let me take the same example forward to answer this question. Say more than two software developers are working on 
the same file and they want to update it simultaneously. Unfortunately, the person who save the file first will get 
precedence over the others. While in Github, this is not the case. Github document the changes and reflect them in an 
organized manner to avoid any chaos between any of the files uploaded. Therefore using GitHub centralized repository,
it avoids all the confusion and working on the same code becomes very easy. GitHub is a central repository and Git is
a tool which allows you to create a local repository. Now people usually get confused between git and GitHub but its 
actually very different. Git is a version control tool that will allow you to perform all kinds of operations to fetch 
data from the central server or push data to it whereas GitHub is a core hosting platform for version control
collaboration. GitHub is a company that allows you to host a central repository in a remote server.


## How to Contribute using Github :

1 .Create a personal fork of the project on Github.

2 . the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.

3 .Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.

4 .If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.

5 .Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.

6 .Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.

7 .Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.

8 .If the project has tests run them!

9 .Write or adapt tests as needed.

10 .Add or change the documentation as needed.

11 .Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.

12 .Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.

13 .From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, 
    else go for master!

14 .Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and 
    delete your extra branch(es).
